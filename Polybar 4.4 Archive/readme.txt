ASSEMBLY NOTES:

	!!! PLEASE READ THESE NOTES AS THEY HAVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR TUNING YOUR GUITAR TO FIT YOUR EXACT HARDWARE NEEDS !!!
	
	The strum boards are printed in such a way that the same file works for up and down strum bar motion.
	You can choose which slot is up or down, but what is important is the Strum_Switch_Insert files placement.
	For proper function, install the Strum_Switch_Insert into the keyswitch with the long edge facing toward the outside edge of the guitar.
	
	For the Joystick, I would reccomend hot glue on the bottom to prevent it from rocking. On the Minibar, and the Polybar's Board_Joystick, you will see a rectangle
	shaped area for the Joystick to lay. Push the joystick board against the wall on the edge of each respective rectangle. On both guitars, the pins for the connection points  face toward the frets.
	I would also reccomend cutting the plastic headers and desoldering the header pins, as it makes it easier to feed your wires underneath and prevent tangling.
	
	For the frets, you should be able to print the entire model with no supports. If you used supports, ensure that the entirety of the teardrop hole is clear of any debris.
	The Fret_Mount_Insert should very easily fall in and almost fall out. This wobble and tolerance is necessary for the frets to move up and down in the housing without getting caught on anything.
	On another note with the frets, you will find alternate files available in your GitHub download. The default height of the Fret_Mount_Insert is 3.5mm.
	If your frets are constantly being pressed down, try printing an insert file that is lowered .5mm to 1mm shorter than the default file. What is happening is your switch isn't being allowed to stretch up
	far enough past its activation point. If your frets are going too far down, then you need to do the opposite. Print an insert file that is raised .5mm to 1mm higher than the default file to tune your press length.
	
	For the strum bar itself on either the Minibar or Polybar, you may experience an issue where your "click" of your switch doesn't properly rebound.
	That typically means that the Strum_Switch_Insert is too high for your switch. You will find alternates of this file available in your GitHub download.
	The default height of the Strum_Switch_Insert is 2mm. Try printing an insert that is lowered .25mm or .5mm shorter to have your Strum Bar properly rebound and click on every press.
	If your strum bar is moving too much or wiggles side to side, do the opposite. Print an insert that is raised .25 or .5mm taller than the default to keep the strum bar in place.
