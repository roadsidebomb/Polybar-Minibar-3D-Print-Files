---POLYBAR 3.0---

This ZIP contains the legacy version of the Polybar for archival purposes.
For the time being, this is the only version that will support the use of an Arcade Encoder.
The F3D file is included in the archive if you would like to modify any specific components.
Most parts need supports for overhangs, except for solid components.

You can find the full assembly guide by user Nickkurszewski for this version of the guitar here: https://imgur.com/gallery/0FSSBHY
